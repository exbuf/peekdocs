# Changelog

All notable changes to docsearch are documented here.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Sensitive Data Scan** — one-click scan for PII and sensitive data: SSNs, credit cards, tax IDs, emails, phone numbers, passwords, dates of birth, and large dollar amounts. Results categorized by severity (HIGH/MODERATE/INFO) with per-file details, line numbers, and a highlighted `.docx` report with yellow-highlighted matches. Click any category to see affected files
- **Email support** — search .eml (standard email), .msg (Outlook), and .pst (Outlook mailbox archive) files. Searches headers (From, To, Subject, Date) and message body
- **Archive support** — search inside .zip, .tar, .gz, .bz2, .tgz, .7z, and .rar archives transparently. Each match shows which file inside the archive it came from
- **Legacy Office formats** — search .doc (Word 97-2003), .xls (Excel 97-2003), and .ppt (PowerPoint 97-2003) files
- **Email alerts** — optional SMTP email notifications when scheduled suite runs detect failures. Configure via GUI (Configure Email Alerts in suite panel)
- **Consolidated suite .docx report** — formatted Word document with color-coded PASS/FAIL summary table, per-stage details, report fingerprint for tamper detection, and source file manifest listing every document in scope
- **View Suite Report button** — appears in suite panel after each run to open the .docx report directly
- **Results preview pane** — inline scrollable preview in the main GUI window showing matches with highlighted terms, filenames, and directory paths after each search
- **Matched files popup with line numbers** — clickable "View N matched file(s)" link on the status line opens a popup listing each file with match count and line numbers (e.g., "contract.docx (3 matches — lines 12, 47, 89)")
- **View Text (with line numbers)** — new button in the matched files popup that displays the file's extracted content with line numbers and highlighted matches, scrolled to the first match. Works for all 46 file types
- **Determinate progress bar** — shows actual file count progress (e.g., "47/200 files") for direct file scanning; indeterminate spinner for indexed searches
- **Text Size dropdown** — Small/Normal/Large/Extra Large scaling for all GUI text and widgets. Auto-saves to config. Located on bottom toolbar
- **Advanced Search Options popup** — moved from collapsible inline panel to a separate window, keeping the main window compact
- **First-run welcome dialog** — getting-started guide appears on first launch with 4-step quick start
- **Clear Error Log button** — on bottom toolbar next to View Error Log
- **Clear Auto-Run History button** — in suite panel next to Open Auto-Run History
- **46 supported file types** (up from 25) — documents, spreadsheets, emails (.eml, .msg, .pst, .mbox), archives, Apple Pages, calendars (.ics), contacts (.vcf), data/config files, and images (OCR)
- **Comprehensive -h help** — rewritten with description, usage syntax, file type list, and sections grouped by purpose (Search Modes, Filters, Output, Index, Settings)
- **Troubleshooting section** expanded to 31 entries covering Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Compliance Wizard** — pick an industry starter template (9 available), review and customize checks, create a search suite with one click. Starter templates for Financial Services/SOX, Healthcare/HIPAA, Legal, Government, Manufacturing/ISO, Education/FERPA, Real Estate, Insurance, and HR
- **Run Suite button** — on the main screen next to Run Search; opens the Manage Suites panel. Green when suites exist, red when none
- **Suite report preview** — after a suite run, the txt report is displayed in the main preview pane
- **Import Template** — new button in Manage Suites to load saved searches and suites from an external .json file, merging into the existing collection without overwriting non-conflicting items
- **Export Suite** — new button in Manage Suites to save the selected suite and all its referenced saved searches to a `.json` file for sharing with colleagues, clients, or other machines
- **Max File Size field** — in Advanced Search Options; files over the limit (default 100 MB) are skipped to prevent memory issues. New `--max-file-size` CLI flag. Changing the value automatically rebuilds the index on the next indexed search so results stay consistent
- **Excluded Files view** — "View N excluded file(s)" button appears after each search, opens a popup listing every file that was NOT searched, grouped by reason (unsupported type, prior output files, oversized, hidden, etc.)
- **Compliance and auditing guide** with industry examples, step-by-step instructions, and 9 pre-built sample suites
- **Limits and Constraints documentation**
- **Files Created by docsearch reference** — complete catalog of every file docsearch generates
- **Index and subfolder documentation** — explains how indexes work across folder hierarchies and with search suites
- **Search Wizard** — guided search configuration with 21 patterns (SSN, phone, email, dates, dollar amounts, etc.). Pick a type, click Apply, and the search bar is configured automatically
- **Recent Searches dropdown** — button next to the search bar remembers your last 10 searches for quick recall
- **PDF highlighted reports** — optional `.pdf` output with yellow-highlighted matches, matching the `.docx` report style. Enable with the PDF checkbox or `-o pdf` on the CLI
- **App Files button** — bottom toolbar button listing all docsearch-created files in the search folder with full paths, grouped by category
- **All Collections button** — bottom toolbar button that scans your home directory for all `.docsearch_collection.json` files, showing saved searches and suites across every folder. Double-click a folder to switch to it
- **Fuzzy search highlighting** — fuzzy matches are now highlighted in the results preview and reports, not just exact matches

### Changed
- **"Save Settings" buttons renamed** — Search Bar button is now "Save Search" (saves to collection for suites); Advanced Search Options button is now "Save Defaults" (saves to ~/.docsearchrc)
- **Advanced Search Options, Search Suites, Manage Indexes** consolidated onto one row
- **README restructured** — slim landing page with detailed docs in `docs/` directory
- **Marketing summary** updated to mention emails, archives, email alerts, and all three interfaces (terminal, GUI, API)
- **Introduction** lists Word docs before PDFs (primary audience is Windows users)
- **.docsearch_collection.json excluded** from search results on all platforms (was already hidden on macOS/Linux but not Windows)
- **docsearch_errors.log and .docsearchrc** also excluded from search results

### Fixed
- Last run label disappeared when auto-run schedule set to Off
- Auto-run suite reports now include .docx format (was only TXT and JSON)
- Suite reports auto-generated on manual runs (previously only on scheduled runs)
- CTkToplevel widget variables reset during initialization (recursive checkbox not persisting)
